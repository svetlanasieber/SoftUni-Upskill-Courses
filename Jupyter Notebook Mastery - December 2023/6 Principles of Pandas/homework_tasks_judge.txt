# 01. Creating Series

import pandas as pd

# For the purpose of this example, let's assume N and the sequence of integers are provided like this:
N = 4  # This should be read using input() in a real program
sequence_of_integers = [56, 53, 20, 21]  # This should also be read using input() in a real program

# Transforming the sequence of integers into a Pandas Series
series = pd.Series(sequence_of_integers)

# Printing the series
print(series)


# 02. Doubled Series

import pandas as pd

# For the purpose of this example, let's assume N and the sequence of integers are provided like this:
N = 3  # This should be read using input() in a real program
sequence_of_integers = [15, 155, 1555]  # This should also be read using input() in a real program

# Transforming the sequence of integers into a Pandas Series
series = pd.Series(sequence_of_integers)

# Multiplying all elements by 2
doubled_series = series * 2

# Printing the doubled series
print(doubled_series)



# 03. Find Duplicates

import pandas as pd

# For the purpose of this example, let's assume N and the sequence of integers are provided like this:
N = 4  # This should be read using input() in a real program
sequence_of_integers = [3, 4, 5, 6]  # This should also be read using input() in a real program

# Transforming the sequence of integers into a Pandas Series
series = pd.Series(sequence_of_integers)

# Checking for duplicates
has_duplicates = series.duplicated().any()

# Printing whether there are duplicates
print(has_duplicates)


# 04. Drop Duplicates

import pandas as pd

# For the purpose of this example, let's assume N and the sequence of integers are provided like this:
N = 3  # This should be read using input() in a real program
sequence_of_integers = [-100, 100, -100]  # This should also be read using input() in a real program

# Transforming the sequence of integers into a Pandas Series
series = pd.Series(sequence_of_integers)

# Dropping duplicates from the series
unique_series = series.drop_duplicates()

# Printing the series without duplicates
print(unique_series)
