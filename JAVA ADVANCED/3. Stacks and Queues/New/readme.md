 stack and a queue are both abstract data types that can be implemented in Java. They are used to store and manipulate a collection of elements. However, they differ in the order in which elements are added and removed.

A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, which means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. In other words, it follows the "last in, first out" principle. Stacks can be implemented in Java using the java.util.Stack class or the java.util.Deque interface with the addFirst() and removeFirst() methods.

A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure, which means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. In other words, it follows the "first in, first out" principle. Queues can be implemented in Java using the java.util.Queue interface with the add() and remove() methods, or the java.util.LinkedList class with the addFirst(), addLast(), removeFirst(), and removeLast() methods.
